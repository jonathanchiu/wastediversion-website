# Waste Diversion LLC

Over the summer of 2013, I briefly interned at a very small start-up called Waste Diversion LLC located in Washington D.C. , where I was in charge of coding and maintaining their website. Through this internship, I had to teach myself HTML, CSS and Javascript and this website is, more or less, the product of all that I learned during that summer. A really big thank you to the [PureCSS](http://purecss.io) front-end framework. None of this would have been remotely possible without it.

#### About

Waste Diversion LLC is a Clinton Global Initiative University 2012 project that has become a business. The business provides waste diversion services (recycling, composting, staffing, planning services, hauling, signs, bins, etc.) to outdoor events.
